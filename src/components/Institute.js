              As a matter of concern, our UT of Puducherry has not seen
              appreciable number of Civil Service Officers and there is no
              single Puducherry Civil Service (PCS) Officer or Puducherry Police
              Service Officer (PPS) directly recruited through Civil Services
              Examinations from this soil. This is quite discouraging inspite of
              the good education and healthy environment prevailing in this
